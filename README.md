# The-Enigma
A sophisticated German WWII Naval Cipher with complex encryption and decryption methods. This project implements the generalized Enigma Machine.

The Enigma Machine uses a  progressive substitution cipher to encrypt messages making it incredibly difficult to decipher. It performed a permutation or one to one mapping on the alphabet onto itself. The Machine is comprised of a series of rotors which have 26 contacts on both sides and are wired both sides to get signals coming from either side of the rotor. How the machine works is that a signal comes through the right most rotor through one of the 26 contacts flows through the wires being permuted through each rotor before being bounced back through the reflector and inversely permuted as it traveled through the rotors again by a different route. Each rotor has a different permutation and the overall encryption of the machine depends on the order they are placed as well as there intial configuration.
